  details: "A mobile dueling CCG game. It featured playing hand combos with loads of Nicklodeon characters! I built the card ability and status effect systems, and the battle animation framework. I also architected and build an in-game event custom abilities system to allow designers to customize event specific battle abilities. I also integrated an in-house authentication system that I worked on, for mobile and Kongregate.com login flows. (Unfortunately, we never ended up releasing the game on Kongregate.)"

  details: "This is a personal project where I reverse engineered and maintained a custom server to run an abandonware online browser fantasy RPG. It was an old school RPG with lengthy encounter descriptions and multiple actions based on your character, and I was hooked playing this on school and library computers. I ended up decompiling and deobfuscating the original Java Applet game binary to add quality of life and balance changes. I also designed and implemented 2 expansions with new content and features. (I had a co-designer on the 2nd expansion, and an artist for the 2 expansions.) Some fun changes: Pilfering/returning loot of other dead players, PvP encounters, self-found mode, hardcore mode, and pulling out the game data (ie: monsters, items, weapons, etc) outside the game client so it can be updated without a new client release."

  details: "Another mobile dueling CCG game. There were lots of whimsical and cheeky pop culture reference where combining any two cards produced something unique to attack your opponent with. I supported the game in maintainance mode and also integrated an in-house authentication system for mobile and Kongregate.com login flows. (The planned Kongregate release was sadly cancelled.)"

  details: "Our studio bought this mobile/desktop/web game from Rhino Games, and our team took over general maintenance mode support. I worked on modernizing bits and pieces of the analytics and diagnostics used in the game. The team and I created a refreshed battle UI/UX, but product leadership decided not to ship the work and we pivoted to another game."

I've worked on a numerous experimental growth and monetization features drafted by product managers. I did enjoy working some interesting and player-focused features like sticker taunts, tournaments and the many customizable game modes."
