<p>Here are my current and past projects!</p>

<h2 id="dragon-court-revived-2023">Dragon Court: Revived (2023)</h2>
<p>I reverse engineered and maintained a custom server to run an abandonware online browser fantasy RPG. I ended up decompiling and deobfuscating the original game binary to add quality of life and balance changes. I also designed and implemented 2 expansions with new content and features. (I co-designed the 2nd expansion.)
<br /><br /></p>

<h2 id="nicklodeon-card-clash-2024">Nicklodeon Card Clash (2024)</h2>
<p>A mobile CCG game. I built the card ability and status effect systems, and the battle animation framework. I also architected and build an in-game event custom abilities system to allow designers to customize event specific battle abilities.
