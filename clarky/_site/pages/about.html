<p>Hey! I’m Clarky Lee, and I absolutely love games. I’m always thinking about weird concepts that could end up as a game and sometimes can’t sleep because of it! I don’t believe we should be chasing trends, but we should be building something unique that’s never been done before and brings joy to the player!</p>

<p>I’ve worked with multiple game engines, but I have the most experience in Unity and Godot. In the past, I’ve worked with Cocos2d, AndEngine, and in my childhood years, GameMaker and MegaZeux.</p>

<p>I’ve contributed to projects of multiple genres, including word games, RPGs, card battlers, puzzle games, and strategy simulation games.</p>

<p>For me, software and game development can seem like puzzles where creativity meets logic. I love a process and it’s been a joy making the many parts of these games feel just right.</p>

<p>I’m always excited to chat about game design and development, and any opportunities! Feel free to check my <a href="/pages/projects.html">projects</a> and <a href="/pages/contact.html">contact me</a> anytime!</p>

<p>If you would like to work with me in any official capacity, you can download and check out my <a href="/assets/Clarky_Lee_Resume.pdf">resume</a>!</p>
