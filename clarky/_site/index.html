<h2 id="-software-and-game-developer-">🐧 Software and Game Developer 🐻</h2>

<p>🎮 Crafting joyful player experiences with code and design.</p>

<p><em>I’m a software and game developer with a passion for building fun and well crafted experiences. I specialize in Unity/C# and Godot games on mobile, desktop and WebGL, but also have experience in general web development and backend systems. Whether it’s RPG mechanics or card battle systems, I enjoy solving interesting design problems and crafting responsive gameplay.</em></p>

<h3 id="dragon-court-revived-2023">Dragon Court: Revived (2023)</h3>
<p>I reverse engineered and maintained a custom server to run an abandonware online browser fantasy RPG. I ended up decompiling and deobfuscating the original game binary to add quality of life and balance changes. I also designed and implemented 2 expansions with new content and features. (I co-designed the 2nd expansion.)

<h3 id="nicklodeon-card-clash-2024">Nicklodeon Card Clash (2024)</h3>
<p>A mobile CCG game. I built the card ability and status effect systems, and the battle animation framework. I also architected and build an in-game event custom abilities system to allow designers to customize event specific battle abilities.
