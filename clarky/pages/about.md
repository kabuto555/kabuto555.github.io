# üçú About üçú

Hey! I'm Clarky Lee, and I absolutely love games. I'm always thinking about weird concepts that could end up as a game and sometimes can't sleep because of it! I don't believe we should be chasing trends, but we should be building something unique that's never been done before and brings joy to the player!

I've worked with multiple game engines, but I have the most experience in Unity and Godot. In the past, I've worked with Cocos2d, AndEngine, and in my childhood years, GameMaker and MegaZeux.

I've contributed to projects of multiple genres, including word games, RPGs, card battlers, puzzle games, and strategy simulation games.

For me, software and game development can seem like puzzles where creativity meets logic. I love a process and it's been a joy making the many parts of these games feel just right.

Outside of the games world, I enjoy training in traditional martial arts, and have trained in a variety of them (not to say that I am equally good at all of them!) Over the years I've tried judo, monkey kung-fu, historical European martial arts, kendo, karate and taekwondo. I want to try sumo wrestling one day!

I also really love noodles. Ramen, spaghetti, vermicelli bowls, udon, Taiwanese beef noodle soup, zarusoba, crispy chow mein, pad thai, dan dan noodles, angel hair... I'll devour them all!

I'm always excited to chat about game design and development, and any opportunities! Feel free to check my [projects](/pages/projects.html) and [contact me](/pages/contact.html) anytime!
